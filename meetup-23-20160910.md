**Content：**

This talk about writing good commit messages aims to act as the beginning of a series of talks about writing quality technical content. To emphasise the importance of the commit messages, the talk asked the audience to set up a profile of the potential reviewer who is as cool and picky as the writer of the technical content, or the writer himself in 5 years. Then the talk introduced what is a good commit message and how to write a good commit message by encouraging the audiences to establish good habits, good format and use simple and consistent language, especially to resist the temptation of using lengthy sentences. Best practices and tools from other projects and also covered to trigger further discussions and action items to improve our project.
